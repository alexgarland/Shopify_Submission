Answer: Peacock

(c) What product was ordered the most by customers in Germany?

There is some uncertainty in this question. I am choosing to interpret which item had the highest overall quantity of items bought by customers in Germany (the alternative interpretation would be which item most often showed up in German orders). 
Query:  SELECT Sum(Quantity) as TotalSold, OD.ProductID, P.ProductName from OrderDetails as OD
Inner Join Orders as O on O.OrderID = OD.OrderID
Inner Join Customers as C on C.CustomerID = O.CustomerID
Inner Join Products as P on P.ProductID = OD.ProductID
Where C.Country == "Germany"
Group By OD.ProductID
ORDER BY TotalSold Desc Limit 1;
